### Detailed Overview of the Home Security System Code

This script is a Python-based home security system that uses a single camera to detect people via the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, sends email notifications when a person is detected, and includes a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for setup and control. Below is a comprehensive overview of its functionality, structure, and potential, as of March 26, 2025.

#### General Purpose and Functionality
The program, named "Anbu - Home Security," is designed for DIY home or small business surveillance. It:
- Captures video from a user-selected camera.
- Uses the YOLOv5s model to detect objects, specifically identifying people.
- Sends an email alert to a specified receiver when a person is detected, with a 60-second cooldown to avoid spam.
- Provides a GUI with start, stop, and exit buttons, plus a splash screen for branding.
- Aims for reliability with error handling and user feedback.

This makes it suitable for individuals seeking an affordable, customizable security solution without subscription fees.

#### Code Structure and Key Components

1. **Imports and Dependencies**
   - **Libraries Used:**
     - `cv2` (OpenCV): For camera capture and video display.
     - `smtplib`, `email.mime.text`, `email.mime.multipart`: For sending email notifications via Gmail’s SMTP server.
     - `os`: To access environment variables for email credentials.
     - `tkinter`, `ttk`: For the GUI, including dialogs and buttons.
     - `ultralytics`: For the YOLO object detection model.
     - `threading`: To run email sending in a separate thread.
     - `time`: For timing the 60-second cooldown.
   - **Dependencies:** Requires `opencv-python`, `ultralytics`, and a working Tkinter installation (standard with Python).

2. **Global Variables and Initialization**
   - **Email Credentials:** `SENDER_EMAIL` and `SENDER_PASSWORD` are loaded from environment variables (`os.getenv`), enhancing security by avoiding hardcoded or user-entered credentials.
   - **Model:** Loads `yolov5s.pt` as the default YOLO model, a lightweight version optimized for speed and accuracy on CPU-based systems.
   - **State Variables:**
     - `person_detected`: Tracks if a person is currently detected (Boolean).
     - `last_detection_time`: Records the time of the last detection for the cooldown.
     - `running`: Controls the surveillance loop (Boolean).

3. **Email Notification Function (`send_email`)**
   - **Purpose:** Sends an "Intruder Alert!" email when a person is detected.
   - **Mechanism:** Uses Gmail’s SMTP server (`smtp.gmail.com`, port 587) with TLS encryption, requiring sender credentials from environment variables.
   - **Error Handling:** Checks for missing credentials and prints errors if the email fails to send (e.g., network issues or invalid credentials).
   - **Output:** Logs success (`✅ Email Sent!`) or failure (`❌ Email error: {e}`) to the console.

4. **Camera Detection Function (`detect_available_cameras`)**
   - **Purpose:** Identifies available camera indices (0 to 4) by attempting to open each with OpenCV.
   - **Implementation:** Returns a list of integers representing valid camera indices.
   - **Limitation:** Tests only up to 5 cameras, which is reasonable for most personal setups but could be expanded for broader compatibility.

5. **Surveillance Loop Function (`start_surveillance`)**
   - **Setup:**
     - Creates a hidden Tkinter root window (`root.withdraw()`) for dialogs.
     - Prompts for receiver email via `simpledialog.askstring`.
     - Lists available cameras and asks for an index via `simpledialog.askinteger`, validating the input.
     - Opens the selected camera with OpenCV, setting resolution to 1280x720.
   - **Loop:**
     - Reads frames continuously while `running` is True.
     - Uses YOLO to detect objects, drawing bounding boxes and labels on the frame.
     - Triggers email notification if a person is detected and wasn’t previously, respecting the 60-second cooldown.
     - Displays the feed in an OpenCV window (`cv2.imshow`).
   - **Error Handling:** Reconnects if the camera disconnects, shows error messages for invalid selections or camera failures.
   - **Exit:** Stops when `running` is False (via stop button) or 'q' is pressed.

6. **Stop Function (`stop_surveillance`)**
   - **Purpose:** Safely terminates the surveillance loop by setting `running` to False.
   - **Integration:** Called by the GUI stop button, improving user control over the previous 'q'-only exit.

7. **GUI Function (`run_app`)**
   - **Splash Screen:** Displays a branded splash screen for 3 seconds with "Anbu Security Services" and a tagline.
   - **Main Window:** A 500x500 dark-themed window with:
     - Title and subtitle labels.
     - Buttons for "Start Surveillance" (green), "Stop Surveillance" (orange), and "Exit" (red).
     - A footer with a copyright notice.
   - **Execution:** Runs in the main thread, using `Thread` to start surveillance without blocking the GUI.

#### How It Runs
- **Startup:** Launching `run_app()` shows the splash screen, then the main GUI.
- **Surveillance Start:** Clicking "Start Surveillance" prompts for email and camera input, then opens a video feed window showing detected objects.
- **Detection:** If a person is detected, an email is sent (first time or after 60 seconds), with bounding boxes on the feed.
- **Control:** Stop via the GUI button or 'q', exit via the GUI button.
- **Feedback:** Console logs email status; Tkinter dialogs handle errors.

An unexpected detail is that the video feed remains in a separate OpenCV window rather than being integrated into the Tkinter GUI, which might surprise users expecting a unified interface.

#### Technical Details
- **Performance:** Runs on CPU by default (no GPU check), suitable for lightweight systems. YOLOv5s is efficient, processing frames in real-time on modest hardware.
- **Resolution:** Fixed at 1280x720, which might not suit all cameras; some may default to lower resolutions if unsupported.
- **Dependencies Installation:** Users need to install `opencv-python` and `ultralytics` via pip; Tkinter is typically included with Python, though Linux users might need `python3-tk`.

#### Strengths
- **Security:** Environment variables for email credentials reduce exposure compared to plain text input.
- **User-Friendly:** GUI with start/stop buttons and clear prompts improves accessibility.
- **Reliability:** Handles camera disconnection and invalid inputs with retries and error messages.
- **Modularity:** Functions are well-separated, making it easy to modify or extend.

#### Potential Areas for Improvement (as Previously Noted)**
- **Model Path Handling:** Hardcoded "yolov5s.pt" could fail if missing; allow user selection or include the file.
- **Camera Resolution:** Fixed 1280x720 limits compatibility; make it configurable.
- **Detection Sensitivity:** No confidence threshold adjustment; add a slider or config option.
- **Notification Strategy:** Fixed 60-second cooldown; allow user customization.
- **Logging:** No event logging; add file or database logging for history.
- **GUI Enhancements:** Integrate video feed into Tkinter or show real-time status.
- **Multiple Notifications:** Only email supported; add SMS or push options.
- **Camera Disconnection:** Retries but doesn’t alert users; add a GUI notification.

#### Suitability for Open-Sourcing
- **Community Appeal:** Its DIY focus, use of open-source tools (OpenCV, YOLO), and clear structure make it attractive for hobbyists and developers on GitHub.
- **Contribution Potential:** Modular design allows contributors to add features like multi-camera support or cloud storage.
- **Educational Value:** As a student project, it demonstrates practical use of Python, computer vision, and GUI programming, ideal for a portfolio.
